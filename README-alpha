* Introduction

This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production use yet.
If you are taking source from CVS, you will need to have several
special tools to help contribute.  See the file README-hacking for more
information.  See chapter `Building' for the detailed instructions on
how to build the package.

Please, note that the accompanying documentation may be inaccurate
or incomplete. The ChangeLog file is the authoritative documentation of
all recent changes.

Please, send comments and problem reports to <bug-gdbm@gnu.org>.

* Checking Out the Sources

The following instructions apply if you wish to obtain sources from
the repository.  There are several repositories:

1. CVS at Puszcza.gnu.org.ua - master repository
   <https://puszcza.gnu.org.ua/cvs/?group=gdbm>
2. Git at Puszcza.gnu.org.ua - slave
   <http://puszcza.gnu.org.ua/git/?group=gdbm>
3. CVS at Savannah.gnu.org - slave
   <http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=gdbm>
4. Git at Savannah.gnu.org - slave
   <http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=gdbm>

Slave repositories are synchronized with the master 8 times a day.

** CVS

To checkout the source tree from CVS issue the following command:

  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gnu.org.ua:/cvsroot/gdbm co gdbm

Or, to checkout the sources from CVS mirror at Savannah, issue the
following command:

  cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gdbm checkout gdbm

** Git  

To clone the Git repository, run:

  git clone git://git.gnu.org.ua/gdbm.git

Or, to clone the secondary GDBM Git mirrror repo, run:

  git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gdbm.git

In all cases, this will give you read-only access.  If you think you need
write access, contact <bug-gdbm@gnu.org>.
